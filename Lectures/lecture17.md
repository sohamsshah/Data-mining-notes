### FP Growth Algorithm

* Take frequent itemsets in sorted order.
* Create a Header Table. Header Table -> Item frequency table
* Construct FP-Tree

### Construct Conditional FP-Tree

For each pattern base
* Accumulate count of each item in the base
* Construct FP tree for the frequent items of the pattern base

### m-conditional pattern base
* Find all paths to **m**
* Now find common items in all paths
* Combine paths by adding frequencies of both paths

### Single FP-tree Path Generation

* Suppose FP-tree has a single path P
* Complete set of frequent pattern of T can be generated by enumeration of all combinations of subpaths of P.

### Why is Frequent Pattern Growth Fast?

* Faster than Apriori
* No candidate generation/test
* Compact DS
* Eliminate repeated scan
* 2 scans only required
* Though, it is Complex to implement.
