### Z-score (Gaussian Distribution)

* It transforms data in such a way that the mean value = 0. Means that the sum of values on left side and sum of values right side are equal. The SD is 1.

* It is a normalization technique

* Given distribution of data, each value will have sample mean value subtracted and then divided by SD of while dataset.

* Formula: ( x_i - mean(x) )/ stdev(x)

* In contrary to minmax transformation, it doesnt guarantee that all dataset attributes will be in same scale. While in minmax, all attributes are in same range.

* While, the Gaussian Distribution solves the problem of outliers.

* Refer: [Covid19 Dataset](https://www.covid19india.org/) for Data Analysis.

* The Gaussian Distribution is Bell Shaped Curve; which is widely seen in the Nature. Eg. the Covid 19 is Bell Shaped curve.

* Bell Shaped curve have a peak value that signifies the time where covid was highest and then the cases started decreaseing.
