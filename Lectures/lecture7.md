### Case Study: Spending Score Data

It has Customer ID, Genre (Male, Female), Age (Numerical), Annual Income (Dollars) and output Spending Score value.

Thorough case study is required to understand the relation between data. We need to develop a model (algorithm) for prediction of unknown set of values in the dataset.

Fill the missing values by proper filling technique. If age parameter of female is missing, then we can take mean of all the female age and replace; instead of all set of values.

The target attribute is called __Class Label__. Never fill the missing values in the Spending Score, and replace them instead.
