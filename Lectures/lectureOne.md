### Data Mining:

* Data Explosion Problem: A lot of data is exploded today in the information age. For proper decision making, there must be confidence. And for that, from the available data, we can draw out conclusions. Here is where, Data Mining comes into place.

* Data Mining is an extraction of interesting knowledge from data in large database.

* Knowledge that is extracted, must be applicable.

* There must be novelty in the knowledge.

### Structured, Semi-structured and Unstructured:

* Structured: SQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS Access
* Semi-structured: JSON, XML, CSV 
* Unstructured: MongoDB Eg. Facebook post, Tweet, Blogs etc.

### Tweet Analysis:
* Combination of words - Gram
* Stemming: Cut out to the root word Eg. reading -> read
* Assign +1 to positive words, -1 to negative and then do analysis
* Total will give sentimental analysis

### Data Mining Vs. Big Data

* Data Mining: We have entire data available before processing starts and we have to mine it.
* Big Data: It is streaming data format in Terbytes.

### 4 V's of Data

* Volume
* Velocity
* Variety
* Veracity

### Large Data Mining Vs. Big Data Mining

* Entire Dataset from single source: Large Data
* Entire Dataset from different sources

### Big Data Sources:

* Sensor data and IOT
* Social Media 

### What is Data Mining?

Data mining refers to extraction or mining of "knowledge" from large amount of data or KDD (Knowledge Discovery from Databases)

Involves AI, ML and Statistics

Data -> Knowledge -> Action -> Goal

Example: Netflix gathers user ratings from users (data), decide what type of movies they like (knowledge), recommend new movies (action) and so that customers stay with netflix (goal).

Other examples: Cancer data, road traffic etc.
