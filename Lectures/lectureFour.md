### Data Mining Architecture:

Architecture paradigms:
1. Collect data from: Database, Data Warehouse, WWW, etc.
2. Cleaning the dataset
3. Integrate and select the features
4. Database and Data Warehouse Server
5. Data Mining Engine (set of algorithms and models)
6. Knowledge Base (manual user inputs regarding the application)
7. Pattern Evaluation
8. Graphical User Interface

Data Mining Engine:
1. Characterization
2. Association
3. Correlation
4. Classification
5. Outlier Analysis

Pattern Evaluation Module:

Employs interestingness measures and interacts with the data mining modules so it focuses into search towards interesting patterns.

* Dense Data: The data points which are nearer to each other in a Dataset.
* Sparse Data: The data points are comparatively far from each other in a Da*taset.

Knowledge base:

* Domain knowledge that is used to guide the search or evaluate the interestingness of patterns.

* It can include concept hierarchies that are used to organize attributes or attribute values into different levels of abstraction.

* Eg. user beliefs etc.

### KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases):

Process:
1. Selection of target data
2. Preprocessing (Remove noise and inconsistent Data)
3. Transformation (approximate for mining by performing aggregation operations) As an example - To make it in same range - Normalize the Data.
4. Data Mining: Apply intelligent methods and algorithms to extract data patterns.
5. Visualization and Knowledge Representation by various techniques.
