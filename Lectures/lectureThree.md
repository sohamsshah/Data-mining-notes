### Classification according to the knowledge to be mined:
* Characterization:We can do characterization based on statistical values such as mean, mode, median etc. Extract whatever possible from data to maximum.

* Discrimination: We can discriminate based on some parameter and divide according to the requirement. Example: Divide data to equal parts, distribute according to a criterea etc.

* Association: Interdependancy between data values. READ: Association Rule Mining

* Correlation Analysis: Understand correlation between attributes, identify redundant attributes and reduce the volume of data; and so reduce computational efficiency.

* Classification and Prediction: Classify based on model and predict the values.

* Clustering: Group them together according to the feature. No need of the model.

* Outlier Analysis: Data suggest that some wrong/fishy. 

    Example: 
    1. Fraud Detection (in Bank Transaction etc.). I usually use credit card for small transaction.     And if suddenly I use it for 50K, it is an outlier!
    2. Gesture Recognition. Some unusal gesture identification
    3. Online examination with videograpy. Gesture Recognition for Fraud Detection
