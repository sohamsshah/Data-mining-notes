### Classification according to the knowledge to be mined (output):
* Characterization:We can do characterization based on statistical values such as mean, mode, median etc. Extract whatever possible from data to maximum.

* Discrimination: We can discriminate based on some parameter and divide according to the requirement. Example: Divide data to equal parts, distribute according to a criterea etc.

* Association: Interdependancy between data values. READ: Association Rule Mining

* Correlation Analysis: Understand correlation between attributes, identify redundant attributes and reduce the volume of data; and so reduce computational efficiency.

* Classification and Prediction: Classify based on model and predict the values.

* Clustering: Group them together according to the feature. No need of the model.

* Outlier Analysis: Data suggest that some wrong/fishy. 

    Example: 
    1. Fraud Detection (in Bank Transaction etc.). I usually use credit card for small transaction.     And if suddenly I use it for 50K, it is an outlier!
    2. Gesture Recognition. Some unusal gesture identification
    3. Online examination with videograpy. Gesture Recognition for Fraud Detection
 

### Classification based on Techniques (processing):
These techniques can be described based on *degree of user interaction*. Example: autonomous systems, query-driven systems

* Methods of Data Analysis employed: Example - ML, stats, visualizations, pattern recogntion, NN, DB oriented, Data Warehouse, Data intensive, OLAP

### Classification based on Applications adapted:
* Retail
* Telecommunication
* Banking
* Fraud Analysis
* Stock Market
* Text Mining
* Web Mining

### On which kind of Data?

* Relational Data: It is a collection of interrated data and aset of software programs to access and manage data. Eg. SQL etc.

* Data Warehouse: Repository of information collected from multiple sources
  Constructed via Data Cleaning, transformation etc.
  
* Transactional Database: In temporal Database - we need Date and Time. While in Transaction Database, we need transaction_id. Each represents a transaction. Eg. Online Shopping etc.

* Other Data: Spatial Data, Engineering Design Data, Image Data, HTML etc.
  *Content Based Image Retrieval: It retrieves the Image based on content queried.*

### EXTRA: Super Market Analysis:
* IF Maggi and Coffee are purchased together and we retrieve it using association rule, then we can:
  1. Keep them together in a rack
  2. Give it a combo with a third item that is lesser sold
  3. Inventory Management
