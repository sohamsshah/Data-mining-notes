Rule - {A,B} => C
Support: Number of items having A,B,C / Total Items

Confidence = (Number of items having A,B,C/Total)/(Number of items having A,B / Total)

Max confidence: 1.0

## Strategy

* A common strategy adopted by many association sule mining algorithms is to decompose the problem into two major subtasks.

1. Frequent Itemset Generation
    - The objective is to find all the itemsets that satisfy the minimum support threshold.
    - These items are called Frequent Itemsets.
2. Rule Generation
    - The Rule that has max confidence above a threshold

## Apriori Algorithm

- Purpose: Apriori Algorithm is an influential algo for mining frequent itemsets for boolean association rules.

- Key Concepts:
    - Frequent Itemsets: The set of item which has minimum support (denoted by Li for ith itemset)
    - Apriori Property: Any subset of frequent itemset must be frequent
    - Join Operation: To find L(k) a set of candidate k-itemsets is generated by Joining L(k-1) itself
