### STANDARD DEVIATION EXAMPLE

* The owner of Indian restaurant is interested in how much people spend at restaurant.

* He examines 10 randomly selected receipts for parties and writes down number of minutes spent at the restuarant:

* He gets SD:17 and Mean:49.2.

* Now, 49.2-17 = 32 and 49.2 + 17 = 66.2

* SD can be thought of measuring how far the data values lie from mean.

* They can improve the average time spent at restaurant by fast service etc ways if he has the data.

* If all data are same, the variance and SD are zero.


### ATTRIBUTE TYPES:

* An attribute is a property of the object.

* It also represents different features of object.

* Attribute types are into 4 categories:
  1. Nominal Attribute: They are named attributes which can be seperated into discrete values. Eg. name, color etc.
  2. Ordinal Attribute: They are order of values, thats important and significant, but difference between each one is not really known. Eg. Rating, Rank etc. We cant quantify it.
  3. Interval Attribute: It comes in form of numerical value where difference between points is meaningful. Eg. Temperature: 10-20, 30-40 etc. It doesnot have true zero.
  4. Ratio: It looks like interval attribute, but it has true value. Eg. weight. It has absolute zero.
